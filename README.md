## Problems that have arisen

<p>One of the problems is the display of a double range in the filter as well as the selection input. All these problems were solved thanks to libraries. There was also a difficulty with the correct filtering when changing the category of goods, it was solved by creating two massive ones and a function that zeroed one of them at the time.</p>
