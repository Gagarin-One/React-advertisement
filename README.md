## Problems that have arisen

<p>One of the problems is the display of a double range in the filter as well as the selection input. All these problems were solved thanks to libraries. There was also a difficulty with the correct filtering when changing the category of goods, it was solved by creating two massive ones and a function that zeroed one of them at the time.</p>

## Setup
To run this project, install it locally using npm:

```
$ cd ../React-advertisement
$ npm install
$ npm start
If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
